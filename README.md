Build Instructions and Tooling to support the Laptops4Kids project

First attempts at an automated script to install Windows 10 on to a laptop.

The windows_10/VERSION/autounattend.xml should be copied to the root of the USB stick.

The licence key included in each autounattend.xml is the Microsoft Official Generic Keys that allow the installation of the appropriate Windows version to occur, however they cannot be used to activate Windows.  Further details available here: https://www.windowsafg.com/keys.html
